Onsite Interview 1:
Design question :
You are given user_id, timestamp, search_query and list of links clicked by user while doing google search. Design a machine learning system which predicts which links to show based on search query.

Onsite Interview 2
Design Question:

Design machine learning system which shows spelling and grammer errors and also suggest suitable correction to them while user is typing on google doc.
Given the output of above model, code the logic in any preferred language (I choose python) which can be used to provide real time correction and predictions to user while he is typing.

Onsite Interview 4

Coding round:
Given a list, find out k elements which produces max sum while you can only take continuous elements from either end.
For eg : [5,4, 3, 10, 1, 1000, 2]
for k = 2, elements would be 1000 and 2, hence max sum = 1002
for k = 3 elements would be 5, 1000 and 2, hence max sum = 1007
for k = 4 elements would be 5,4,1000,2, hence max sum = 1011

Interviewer told me the question verbally and couln't explain hence I have spent 15 mins trying to understand what she wants me to code. I have still completed the question within 45 mins but got negative feedback.

Onsite Interview 5
Design round: Detect advertisement boxes within youtube videos using machine learning.

Coding round: Given above machine learning model, Write code in any language which returns frame range/timestamp range and x,y position of the all advertisement boxes in a specific video.
